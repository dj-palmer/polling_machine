## General comments
- I tried to develop the polling machine as a minimum viable product, getting 
 something working quickly without worrying about extra components like 
 databases etc. When 'auto-voting' please keep to 250k votes or below.

 - The program is designed with the minimum of setup needed...
 e.g. not using a database. This turned out to be the way not to do it,
 , since the application struggles when it gets passed 250k votes.

 - My basic thinking was to do all the checks up front, so that we know all 
   votes placed to the candidates are valid, and we don't need to filter
   out any illegal votes when counting. This has resulted in a very quick display
   of the poll, but it takes an hour to build a poll with 1m votes :/

 - Sady, I did not get time to make improvements to the code, when I found it to be
  so underperformant. Having had more time I would have looked at
  * splitting out the candidates votes to reduce the sizes of arrarys produced.
  * hooking into a database, and analysing the votes there
  * storing the total votes in the candidate object
